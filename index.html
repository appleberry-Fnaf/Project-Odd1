            <p>Odd1isout is my 2 favorite inspiration because he encourages us to be ourselves an dbe as funny as possible. And also follow our dreams. I didn't know that there was such a wonderful job like animation or being a ytber exsited. Now that i do i think i might become an animator as well. And encourage people to follow they're dreams!
